## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔑 Direct In-App Login**: Sign in directly using your CyberVidya Roll Number / Student ID, Password, and 6-digit OTP.
- **📊 Real-Time Attendance Overview**: Instant view of total lectures, present count, extra attendance, current percentages, safe bunks left, and lectures needed to reach target thresholds (e.g., 75%).
- **🔥 Streak Tracker & Reliability Index**: Calculates strict consecutive attendance streaks across subjects with data reliability indicators.
- **🎯 Bunk Strategy & Recovery Planner**: Forecasts future attendance based on planned bunks across upcoming weeks and builds custom recovery plans.
- **🌀 Multiverse Simulator ("What If?")**: Interactive scenario engine allowing students to simulate custom bunking and attendance patterns to view ripple effects.
- **📅 Today's Live Status & Schedule**: Real-time daily timetable breakdown with class timings, subject components, and attendance status.
- **🗓️ 12-Week Schedule Calendar**: Weekly timetable grid with progressive background loading across 12 future weeks.
- **📜 Detailed Date-wise Lecture Logs**: Complete history of every attended, missed, and extra attendance lecture per subject.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Model

- **Client-Side AES-128-CBC Encryption**: Password and Roll Number encryption is executed directly in your browser using the native Web Crypto API prior to transmission.
- **Zero Credential Persistence**: Credentials and authentication tokens are kept strictly in your browser's local storage (`localStorage`). Credentials are never saved on external servers.
- **Stateless Serverless Proxy**: The Vercel API proxy (`/api/cybervidya`) forwards authenticated API requests directly to CyberVidya (`kiet.cybervidya.net`). Tokens are sent transiently per-request via headers and are never persisted or logged.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, React Router v7, Vite PWA Plugin, Web Crypto API (AES-128-CBC), Custom CSS Tokens (Light/Dark themes)
- **Backend / Serverless**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js/TypeScript), Supabase (PostgreSQL for Web Push subscriptions & daily snapshots), `web-push`
